# Archive Zone

## Purpose
The archive zone stores historical data that is no longer actively used but needs to be retained for compliance, regulatory, or future reference purposes.

## What Goes Here
- Historical data snapshots
- Deprecated datasets
- Data no longer needed for daily operations
- Compliance-related data

## Rules
- Data should be compressed to save space
- Include metadata about archiving process
- Document retention periods
- Data should be accessible but may have slower retrieval times

## Example Files
- `historical/artist_performance/2023/q1_performance.parquet`
- `retired/campaigns/2023/campaign_analytics_2023.parquet`

## Next Step
Data remains here until retention policies dictate its deletion.
