# Archive Zone

## Purpose
The archive zone is the final destination for historical data that is no longer actively used but must be retained for compliance, regulatory, audit, or potential future reference purposes. This zone ensures data preservation while maintaining optimal performance in active zones.

## What Goes Here
- **Historical data snapshots**: Time-series data archived after defined retention periods
- **Deprecated datasets**: Legacy data structures no longer in use but retained for reference
- **Regulatory compliance data**: Data required by law or policy to be preserved
- **Audit trails**: Complete historical records of data transformations and lineage
- **End-of-lifecycle curated datasets**: Business-ready data that has aged out of active use
- **Legacy system exports**: Data from retired platforms or discontinued integrations

## Archival Rules & Standards

### Data Format Requirements
- **Compression**: All data must be compressed using Parquet, gzip, or similar efficient formats
- **Metadata**: Include comprehensive metadata about source, archival date, and retention policy
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed data dictionaries and schema documentation
- **Integrity**: Include checksums and validation hashes for data integrity verification

### Retention Management
- **Retention periods**: Document and enforce retention policies per data type
- **Automated cleanup**: Implement scheduled deletion for data beyond retention limits
- **Legal holds**: Flag data subject to legal or regulatory holds to prevent deletion
- **Access controls**: Restrict access to archived data based on business need and compliance requirements

### Performance Considerations
- **Storage optimization**: Use cold storage tiers for cost efficiency
- **Query performance**: Archived data may have slower retrieval times
- **Indexing**: Maintain minimal indexing for essential searches
- **Batch processing**: Prefer batch over real-time access patterns

## Integration with Data Lake

### Promotion to Archive
Data typically flows to archive from:
- **Curated zone**: Business-ready datasets that have aged out
- **Staging zone**: Processed data no longer needed for active analytics
- **Raw zone**: Validated source data beyond operational retention periods

### Archive Triggers
- Time-based policies (e.g., data older than 2 years)
- Storage capacity thresholds
- Compliance requirements
- Business rule changes

## Access Patterns

### Retrieval Methods
- **Self-service**: Limited read access for authorized users
- **Request-based**: Formal data request process for sensitive archived data
- **Compliance audits**: Structured access for regulatory requirements
- **Data recovery**: Emergency procedures for restoring critical archived data

### Common Use Cases
- Historical trend analysis and reporting
- Compliance audits and regulatory reporting
- Data recovery and disaster recovery scenarios
- Legacy system migration and validation
- Long-term performance benchmarking

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Data Quality Checks
- Regular integrity validation using stored checksums
- Metadata consistency verification
- Schema evolution tracking
- Access pattern monitoring

### Cost Management
- Storage cost optimization through tiering
- Compression ratio monitoring
- Retention policy enforcement
- Archive utilization reporting

## Next Steps
Data in the archive zone remains until:
- **Retention expiry**: Automatic deletion per documented policies
- **Legal requirements**: Compliance-driven retention extension
- **Business needs**: Potential restoration to active zones for special analysis
- **System migration**: Transfer to new archive systems or formats
