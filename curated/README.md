# Curated Zone

## Purpose
The curated zone contains business-ready datasets that are optimized for analytics and reporting. This is the main consumption layer for end-users and applications.

## What Goes Here
- Business-ready datasets
- Aggregated and summarized data
- Enriched data with business logic applied
- Data marts for specific use cases
- Cleaned daily streaming CSVs generated by sandbox notebooks (see `sandbox/distrokid_raw_exploration.ipynb` and `sandbox/toolost_raw_exploration.ipynb`)

## Rules
- Data must be well-documented
- Schemas should be stable and versioned
- Include data dictionaries
- Data should be optimized for query performance
- Access controls must be enforced

## Example Files
- `business/artist_performance/daily/2024/05/22/performance_metrics.parquet`
- `marketing/campaign_analytics/q2_2024/campaign_summary.parquet`
- `daily_streams_distrokid.csv` (from DistroKid HTML, cleaned/validated)
- `daily_streams_toolost.csv` (from TooLost JSON, cleaned/validated)

## Next Step
Data is consumed by analytics tools, dashboards, and ML models.
