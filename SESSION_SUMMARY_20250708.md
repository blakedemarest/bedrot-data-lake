# Session Summary - July 8, 2025

## Session Overview
This session focused on resolving critical data pipeline issues, specifically:
1. TikTok zone.a0 QR code authentication problems
2. TooLost data extraction failures since May 26
3. Implementation of semi-manual authentication workflow

## Problems Identified & Resolved

### 1. TikTok Zone A0 Authentication Issue
**Problem**: Zone A0 TikTok extractor required QR code login every time, while pig1987 did not.

**Root Cause**: Missing cookie file for zone.a0 account.

**Solution**: 
- Found zone.a0 cookies at ecosystem root: `zone_a0_cookies.json`
- Copied to correct location: `src/tiktok/cookies/tiktok_cookies_zonea0.json`
- Created cookie management script: `src/tiktok/manage_cookies.py`

### 2. TooLost Data Pipeline Blockage
**Problem**: TooLost data hadn't been extracted since May 26, despite July 6 data being available.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- JWT token in cookies expired on June 12 (7-day validity)
- Automated scraper fails silently when cookies expire
- Directory mismatch: newer files in `raw/toolost/` but cleaner looking in `raw/toolost/streams/`

**Solution**:
- TooLost cleaner already updated to check both directories
- Need manual cookie refresh via `python src/toolost/extractors/toolost_scraper.py`

### 3. DistroKid Data Status
**Finding**: DistroKid pipeline working correctly, last run July 4.
- Data available through July 4
- July 5-6 data would be available after next extraction

## Implementation of Semi-Manual Authentication Workflow

### New Components Created/Updated:

1. **Pipeline Health Monitor** (`src/common/pipeline_health_monitor.py`)
   - Removed unnecessary pandas import
   - Tracks data freshness across all zones
   - Detects cookie expiration
   - Identifies pipeline bottlenecks
   - Provides actionable recommendations

2. **Authentication Check Wrapper** (`src/common/run_with_auth_check.py`)
   - Updated with correct extractor paths
   - Fixed cookie directory paths (now checks service-specific directories)
   - Added support for TikTok multiple accounts
   - Service configuration with proper expiration times

3. **New Batch File** (`cronjob/run_bedrot_pipeline.bat`)
   - Interactive pipeline execution
   - Health check before extraction
   - Authentication status display
   - Continues with cleaners even if extractors fail
   - Fixed environment variable syntax error

4. **Test Script** (`test_pipeline_components.py`)
   - Verifies all components work correctly
   - Checks directory structure
   - Tests imports and functionality

### Current Pipeline Health (as of July 8, 2025)

| Service | Health Score | Data Age | Cookie Status | Action Needed |
|---------|--------------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Spotify | 90% | Current | Valid (21d) | Run cleaners |
| TikTok | 50% | 13 days | Fresh (0d) | Extract & clean |
| DistroKid | 80% | Current | Expired (26d) | Refresh cookies & clean |
| TooLost | 15% | 32 days | Expired (26d) | Refresh cookies urgently |
| Linktree | 65% | 5 days | Valid (26d) | Run cleaners |
| MetaAds | 20% | 13 days | Missing | Configure auth |

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified:
1. `/data_lake/src/common/pipeline_health_monitor.py` - Removed pandas import
2. `/data_lake/src/common/run_with_auth_check.py` - Updated paths and cookie locations
3. `/data_lake/cronjob/run_bedrot_pipeline.bat` - Fixed syntax error
4. `/data_lake/CLAUDE.md` - Comprehensive update with current status

### Created:
1. `/data_lake/src/tiktok/cookies/tiktok_cookies_zonea0.json` - Zone A0 cookies
2. `/data_lake/src/tiktok/manage_cookies.py` - Cookie management utility
3. `/data_lake/src/common/auth_check_wrapper.py` - Initial auth wrapper (duplicate)
4. `/data_lake/cronjob/run_bedrot_pipeline.bat` - New interactive pipeline
5. `/data_lake/test_pipeline_components.py` - Component testing script
6. `/data_lake/SESSION_SUMMARY_20250708.md` - This summary

## How to Run the Updated Pipeline

### Interactive Mode (Recommended):
```bash
cd "C:\Users\Earth\BEDROT PRODUCTIONS\bedrot-data-ecosystem\data_lake"
cronjob\run_bedrot_pipeline.bat
```

This will:
1. Show pipeline health status
2. Display authentication status for all services
3. Prompt for manual login when cookies expired
4. Run extractors with fresh cookies
5. Always run cleaners (even if some extractors fail)
6. Show final health report

### Automated Mode:
```bash
cronjob\run_bedrot_pipeline.bat --automated
```
- Skips services requiring manual authentication
- Suitable for scheduled/cron execution

### Individual Operations:
```bash
# Check health only
python src\common\pipeline_health_monitor.py

# Check auth status
python src\common\run_with_auth_check.py --check-only

# Run specific services
python src\common\run_with_auth_check.py toolost distrokid

# Refresh specific service cookies
python src\toolost\extractors\toolost_scraper.py
python src\distrokid\extractors\dk_auth.py
```

## Next Steps for User

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Refresh TooLost cookies** (highest priority - 32 days old):
   ```bash
   cd data_lake
   python src\toolost\extractors\toolost_scraper.py
   ```

2. **Refresh DistroKid cookies**:
   ```bash
   python src\distrokid\extractors\dk_auth.py
   ```

3. **Configure MetaAds authentication** (if needed)

4. **Run full pipeline to catch up**:
   ```bash
   cronjob\run_bedrot_pipeline.bat
   ```

### Weekly Maintenance:
- TooLost cookies expire every 7 days - set weekly reminder
- Run health check regularly: `python src\common\pipeline_health_monitor.py`
- Monitor for services approaching cookie expiration

## Key Learnings

1. **Cookie Management is Critical**: Different services have different expiration times (7-90 days)
2. **Silent Failures**: Some extractors fail silently when cookies expire
3. **Directory Structures**: Services may write to different locations over time
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Pipeline should continue even when some services fail
5. **Visibility**: Health monitoring and clear status reporting are essential

## Technical Debt Addressed
- ✅ Fixed TikTok multi-account authentication
- ✅ Resolved TooLost directory mismatch
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive health monitoring
- ✅ Created semi-manual authentication workflow
- ✅ Updated documentation with current state

## Future Improvements Suggested
- Automated cookie refresh notifications
- Unified dashboard for pipeline status
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Data quality metrics in health monitor
- Cookie expiration forecasting

## Session Duration
Approximately 2 hours of analysis, implementation, and testing.

## Outcome
Successfully resolved critical authentication issues and implemented a robust semi-manual pipeline that handles authentication gracefully while providing clear visibility into system health.
