# Data Lake Pipeline Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Tee Command Issue** ✅
- **Problem**: Windows doesn't have the `tee` command used for dual output
- **Solution**: Replaced all `tee -a "%LOG_FILE%"` with separate echo commands

### 2. **Log File Path Issue** ✅
- **Problem**: "The system cannot find the path specified" errors due to spaces in path
- **Solution**: Simplified log file creation with error checking and fallback to `nul` if logging fails

### 3. **ERRORLEVEL Checking** ✅
- **Problem**: Batch files need to capture ERRORLEVEL immediately after command execution
- **Solution**: Store ERRORLEVEL in variables right after each Python command

### 4. **Early Exit Issue** ✅
- **Problem**: Script was closing immediately on errors
- **Solution**: Added debug output and better error handling

## Test Scripts Available

1. **run_datalake_cron_debug.bat** - Debug version with pauses and detailed checks
2. **run_datalake_cron_simple.bat** - Simplified version without logging for testing
3. **test_pipeline_step1.bat** - Tests cookie status check only
4. **test_pipeline_step2.bat** - Tests pipeline health monitor only
5. **test_single_extractor.bat** - Tests Spotify extractor only
6. **test_cleaners.bat** - Tests cleaner discovery and execution

## Current Status

The pipeline is now running successfully with:
- ✅ All 6 steps executing (Cookie check, Health monitor, Extractors, Cleaners, Warehouse ETL, Reporting)
- ✅ Proper error tracking (7 extraction failures shown correctly)
- ✅ All cleaners running successfully
- ✅ Log file being created (though with some path warnings)

## Usage

Run the main pipeline:
```batch
cd "C:\Users\Earth\BEDROT PRODUCTIONS\bedrot-data-ecosystem\data_lake"
cronjob\run_datalake_cron.bat
```

Run without extractors (cleaners only):
```batch
cronjob\run_datalake_cron_no_extractors.bat
```

## Next Steps

1. Check the log file for specific extractor failures
2. Verify data is flowing from landing → raw → staging → curated
3. Check individual service cookies if extractors are failing
4. Consider running test scripts for specific failing components
