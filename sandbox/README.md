# Sandbox Zone

## Purpose
The sandbox zone is a playground for data exploration, experimentation, and prototyping. Users can freely explore data without affecting production datasets.

## What Goes Here
- Experimental data processing
- Proof of concept work
- Temporary datasets
- User-specific workspaces

## Rules
- No production dependencies
- Clean up after yourself
- Document your experiments
- No sensitive data unless properly secured
- Resources may be limited

## Example Files
- `experiments/artist_clustering/clustering_results.parquet`
- `user/john_doe/stream_analysis/exploration.ipynb`

## Next Step
Successful experiments can be promoted to the `staging` zone for productionization.
