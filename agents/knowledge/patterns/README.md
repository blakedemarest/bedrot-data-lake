This directory documents recurring data patterns, schemas, and transformations used across the data lake. It serves as a reference for data producers and consumers.

## What Goes Here
- Common data schemas
- Transformation patterns
- Data quality rules
- Best practices
- Reference implementations

## Rules
- Keep documentation up-to-date
- Include examples
- Version schemas when they change
- Reference related patterns
- Include validation rules

## Example Files
- `schemas/streaming_data_v1.json`
- `transformations/artist_name_normalization.md`

## Next Step
Use these patterns as templates when designing new data flows.
