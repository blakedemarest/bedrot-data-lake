## Example Decision Records

### ADR-001: Data Lake Zone Architecture
```markdown
# ADR-001: Multi-Zone Data Lake Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
BEDROT needs a scalable, maintainable data architecture to handle diverse data sources (streaming platforms, social media, advertising) with different quality levels and processing requirements.

## Decision
Implement a five-zone data lake architecture: Landing, Raw, Staging, Curated, and Archive zones.

## Rationale
- **Separation of concerns**: Each zone has a specific purpose and quality level
- **Data lineage**: Clear progression from source to consumption
- **Quality gates**: Validation checkpoints prevent poor quality data propagation
- **Flexibility**: Support for both batch and streaming processing patterns
- **Compliance**: Archive zone supports regulatory and audit requirements

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Single-zone approach**: Too simplistic for complex data quality requirements
2. **Three-zone architecture**: Insufficient granularity for quality management
3. **Cloud-native data lake**: Premature given current infrastructure constraints

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Clear data quality progression
- Simplified debugging and troubleshooting
- Scalable architecture for future growth
- Compliance and audit capabilities

**Negative:**
- Increased complexity in pipeline management
- Additional storage overhead
- More complex deployment procedures

## Implementation
- Create directory structure for each zone
- Implement zone-specific validation rules
- Develop promotion scripts between zones
- Establish monitoring for each zone

## Related Decisions
- ADR-002: Storage format selection
- ADR-003: Processing framework choices
```

### Technology Decision Example
```markdown
# TECH-002: Database Technology Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Need to select appropriate database technology for analytics workloads, considering performance, cost, maintenance overhead, and integration requirements.

## Decision
Use SQLite for local analytics database with future migration path to cloud-based solutions.

## Rationale
- **Zero administration**: No database server setup or maintenance required
- **Performance**: Excellent for read-heavy analytical workloads up to moderate scale
- **Integration**: Native Python support with pandas and other analytics tools
- **Cost**: No licensing or hosting costs
- **Deployment**: Single file database simplifies backup and deployment
- **Migration path**: Can export to other database systems when scaling needs arise

## Alternatives Considered
1. **PostgreSQL**: More powerful but adds operational complexity
2. **MySQL**: Similar trade-offs to PostgreSQL
3. **Cloud databases**: Premature optimization given current scale
4. **NoSQL solutions**: Poor fit for analytical workloads

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Rapid development and deployment
- Minimal operational overhead
- Excellent Python ecosystem integration
- Simple backup and disaster recovery

**Negative:**
- Limited concurrent write performance
- No built-in replication or high availability
- Manual scaling when growth requires it
```

## Decision Review Process

### Regular Review Schedule
- **Quarterly reviews**: Assess decision outcomes and relevance
- **Annual architecture review**: Comprehensive evaluation of all decisions
- **Triggered reviews**: When circumstances change significantly
- **Post-implementation reviews**: Validate decision outcomes after implementation

### Review Criteria
```python
# Example: Decision review framework
class DecisionReview:
    def __init__(self, decision_id, original_decision):
        self.decision_id = decision_id
        self.original_decision = original_decision
    
    def assess_decision_validity(self):
        """Assess if decision is still valid"""
        assessment = {
            'context_changed': self.has_context_changed(),
            'outcomes_met': self.are_outcomes_being_met(),
            'alternatives_emerged': self.have_new_alternatives_emerged(),
            'constraints_evolved': self.have_constraints_changed()
        }
        
        validity_score = self.calculate_validity_score(assessment)
        
        if validity_score < 0.7:
            return {
                'status': 'requires_review',
                'recommendations': self.generate_review_recommendations(assessment)
            }
        
        return {'status': 'valid', 'score': validity_score}
```

        """Track actual outcomes vs expected outcomes"""
        decision = self.load_decision(decision_id)
        expected_outcomes = decision['consequences']
        
        actual_outcomes = self.measure_actual_outcomes(decision_id)
        
        variance_analysis = {
            'positive_outcomes': self.compare_outcomes(
                expected_outcomes['positive'], 
                actual_outcomes['positive']
            ),
            'negative_outcomes': self.compare_outcomes(
                expected_outcomes['negative'], 
                actual_outcomes['negative']
            ),
            'unexpected_outcomes': actual_outcomes.get('unexpected', []),
            'overall_success_score': self.calculate_success_score(expected_outcomes, actual_outcomes)
        }
        
        return variance_analysis
```

## Knowledge Management Integration

### Cross-Reference System
- **Decision dependencies**: Track which decisions depend on others
- **Pattern linkage**: Connect decisions to common patterns and practices
- **Agent integration**: AI agents can query decision rationale for automated decision-making
- **Documentation sync**: Ensure decisions are reflected in technical documentation

### Search and Discovery
```python
# Example: Decision search and recommendation system
class DecisionSearchEngine:
    def search_decisions(self, query, context=None):
        """Search decisions by topic, technology, or impact"""
        results = []
        
        # Full-text search across decision documents
        text_matches = self.full_text_search(query)
        
        # Semantic search for related concepts
        semantic_matches = self.semantic_search(query, context)
        
        # Combine and rank results
        combined_results = self.combine_and_rank(text_matches, semantic_matches)
        
        return combined_results
    
    def recommend_related_decisions(self, current_decision_context):
        """Recommend related decisions for consideration"""
        similar_decisions = self.find_similar_decisions(current_decision_context)
        
        recommendations = []
        for decision in similar_decisions:
            relevance_score = self.calculate_relevance(decision, current_decision_context)
            if relevance_score > 0.7:
                recommendations.append({
                    'decision': decision,
                    'relevance': relevance_score,
                    'reason': self.explain_relevance(decision, current_decision_context)
                })
        
        return sorted(recommendations, key=lambda x: x['relevance'], reverse=True)
